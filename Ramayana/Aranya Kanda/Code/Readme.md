# Python Jupyter Notebook
* Code written in the notebook is uploaded
* The code needs the base URL. Please contact to get the base URL. Or you may find it using Inspect option in your browser.
* The project folder in your local machine has to be specified before running the code
* Download the .html to view properly (Github viewer does not display correctly)
* Download the .ipynb to run as notebook
* Download the .py and run in your Python environment (v3.10.9) (this is rare, but possible; the output here is not created with .py but with .ipynb)
* Feedback is welcome
