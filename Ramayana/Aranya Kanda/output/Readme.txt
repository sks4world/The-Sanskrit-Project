The approach: 
The methodology employed in this GitHub project is straightforward. The primary focus is on direct comprehension of the source material. In case questions arise during this process, users are encouraged to seek insights from commentaries authored by our revered Acharyas. These commentaries serve as guides, elucidating how to interpret and apply the teachings in our own lives.

In instances where explanations from Acharyas are unavailable, users are advised to approach their own Guru, the head of their mutt, or an individual well-versed and respected within the Sanatana Dharma community. This ensures a comprehensive and reliable source of clarification for a deeper understanding of the content.
