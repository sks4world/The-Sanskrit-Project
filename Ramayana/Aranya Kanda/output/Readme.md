*     आगमिष्यति मे भर्ता वन्यम् आदाय पुष्कलम् | रुरून् गोधान् वराहान् च हत्वा आदाय अमिषान् बहु || ३-४७-२३
* Chapter 73 has some references to be studied

### The approach: 

The methodology employed in this project is straightforward. The primary focus is on direct comprehension of the source material. In case questions arise during this process, what is the recourse? Users could consider to seek insights from commentaries authored by our revered Acharyas. These commentaries serve as guides, elucidating how to interpret and apply the teachings in our own lives. 

Primary Archarya is Sri Adi Shankara. He presribed Sanatana Dharmis to live as prescribed in the Vedas. From his holiness branched two Acharyas namely Sri Madhwacharya, Sri Ramanujacharya. They established many mutts across India.

In addition to the moola Acharyas, there are many upa-acharyas and many mutts. In instances where explanations from Acharyas are unavailable, one can approach them too, provided, they follow Sanatana Dharma as prescribed in the Vedas, or may approach their own Guru or an individual well-studies, well-versed and well-respected within the Sanatana Dharma community. This ensures a comprehensive and reliable source of clarification for a deeper understanding of the content.

### The reasoning:

As an example, for those aspiring to master the Python language, it is recommended to seek guidance from an experienced Python practitioner. Gaining unbiased knowledge about Python from a Java practitioner may present challenges. Following a thorough understanding of Python, if there's an interest in learning Java, it is advisable to acquire that knowledge from a proficient Java practitioner. This approach facilitates effective comparison and comprehension.

In a parallel manner, the study of Sanatana Dharma is best undertaken under the guidance of practitioners who approach it with reverence. Similar principles apply to research work, where a comprehensive understanding stems from past knowledge derived from esteemed sources within the specific domain.
