### This work searches for the words that mention meat:
* There are verses that do not directly mention meat, but indirectly refer flesh. For example:
*     समाश्वस मुहूर्तम् तु शक्यम् वस्तुम् इह त्वया || ३-४७-२२ 
*     आगमिष्यति मे भर्ता वन्यम् आदाय पुष्कलम् | रुरून् गोधान् वराहान् च हत्वा आदाय अमिषान् बहु || ३-४७-२३
* Chapter 73 has some references to be studied

Code that generated the output by searching the webpages is posted for review 

Output images contain the tables created by this code. 
*     tb1.png is a Quality check table (known patterns are given and checked if the lines were extracted): passed
*     tb2.png contains the references from Aranya Kanda
*     tb3.png contains supportive context
*     tb4.png also contains supportive context

### The approach: 

The methodology employed in this project is straightforward. The primary focus is on direct comprehension of the source material. In case questions arise during this process, what is the recourse? Users could consider to seek insights from commentaries authored by our revered Acharyas. These commentaries serve as guides, elucidating how to interpret and apply the teachings in our own lives. 

Primary Archarya is Sri Adi Shankara. He presribed Sanatana Dharmis to live as prescribed in the Vedas. From his holiness branched two Acharyas namely Sri Madhwacharya, Sri Ramanujacharya. They established many mutts across India.

In addition to the moola Acharyas, there are many upa-acharyas and many mutts. In instances where explanations from Acharyas are unavailable, one can approach them too, provided, they follow Sanatana Dharma as prescribed in the Vedas, or may approach their own Guru or an individual well-studies, well-versed and well-respected within the Sanatana Dharma community. This ensures a comprehensive and reliable source of clarification for a deeper understanding of the content.

# The reasoning:

If someone wants to learn Python language, it is ideal to get that knowledge from a well versed Python practitioner. Same kind of knowledge about Python language, without bias, is difficult to get from a Java practitioner. Before or after learning Python thoroughly, if there is interest to learn Java language, then by all means learning Java from the Java practitioner is ideal. It may help to compare.
Similarly, Sanatana Dharma has to be learnt from those who practise it with reverence, not from anyone else.
Research work follows the same principle. An understanding of something is based upon the past knowledge from renowned sources in that domain.
