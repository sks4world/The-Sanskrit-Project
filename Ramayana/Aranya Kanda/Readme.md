The project urges users to move beyond a line-by-line understanding of references, fostering an environment where they can envision and comprehend the broader narrative.

To enhance the experience, it is recommended to approach the content without relying on one's own existing knowledge or biases. The project encourages curiosity about the written material, its style, and the inferences drawn.
